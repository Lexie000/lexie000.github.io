- **Resume**: PDF download/view
- **Contact**: Email, LinkedIn, GitHub

## Tech stack
- Static site (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Theme base: HTML5 UP “Dimension”

## Local development
Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a simple local server:

- Added custom styles in `assets/css/custom.css` (project cards, layout tweaks, etc.)
