# lexie000.github.io — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website (GitHub Pages), built on top of the **Dimension** theme by HTML5 UP and customized by me.

- **Resume**: PDF download/view
- **Contact**: Email, LinkedIn, GitHub

## Tech stack
- Static site (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Theme base: HTML5 UP “Dimension”

## Local development
Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a simple local server:
- (Optional) VS Code Live Server extension

## Customizations (what I changed)
- Updated site copy and section structure (Intro / Projects / Resume / Contact)
- Added custom styles in `assets/css/custom.css` (project cards, layout tweaks, etc.)
- Replaced the default background image with my own photo: `images/bg1.jpg`
- Added/updated project images in `images/` (see credits below)
